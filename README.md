# Welcome to the lab!

I'm writing this collection of Jupyter notebooks to be used as introductory materials for new undergrads. I will assume you know enough Python (should be familiar with object-oriented programming and whatever package manager / IDE you are using) as well as the first couple of chapters of *Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis*, written by Blankenship.
